# What is it?

We implement a simple SQL generator using golang.

It's nothing but a homework to learn golang interface.

# What does it look like?

run `make build` to build a binary file in `examples/`, and then run it:

```bash
# 03-sqlgenerator on üå± main via üêπ v1.17.2 
‚ùØ make build
go build -o examples/sql-generator.out examples/main.go

# 03-sqlgenerator on üå± main [!?] via üêπ v1.17.2 
‚ùØ ./examples/sql-generator.out 
SELECT [ID],[Name],[AGE] FROM [Student] WHERE [ID]='0906'  ORDER BY [ID] ASC 
SELECT [ID],[Name],[AGE] FROM [Student] WHERE [ID]='0906'  ORDER BY [ID] ASC  offset 0 rows fetch next 20 rows only 
SELECT `ID`,`Name`,`AGE` FROM `Student` WHERE `ID`='0906'  ORDER BY `ID` ASC 
SELECT `ID`,`Name`,`AGE` FROM `Student` WHERE `ID`='0906'  ORDER BY `ID` ASC  limit 0,20

```
